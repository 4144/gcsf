\chapter{Introduction}

The past decade has brought the rise of cloud storage services as an extension of traditional disk-based storage systems. There are many options to choose from, and multiple ways of interacting with them. Chapter \ref{state_of_the_art}  analyses some of the most popular choices. This thesis will focus on a particular service -- Google Drive.

Unfortunately, business requirements encourage companies to target the largest demographic possible, in order to provide the best experience for the average user. This puts advanced users at a disadvantage. Chapter \ref{proposed_approach} aims to provide a solution tailored specifically for them. This solution comes in the form of a new desktop application for Unix-like systems, named GCSF. GCSF is a virtual file system built on top of Google Drive, allowing users to mount their account locally and interact with it as they would with a traditional disk-based storage system.

Chapter \ref{performance_evaluation} explores existing alternatives and compares them against GCSF, focusing on two aspects -- performance and user experience.

Finally, Chapter \ref{conclusion} provides some directions for further development and improvement, and reflects on the progress made since the beginning of this project.
